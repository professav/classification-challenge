# classification-challenge

In this challenge, I was able to test, train, and spit data. After ruuning the Random Classification model and the Logistic Model, I was able to create, fit and score both models to see which one peformed better. I first predicted Random Forest because it usually performs better because it considers non-linear. It worked out that both performed the same with .01% difference.
